Voice call bot

This is the API endpoint that will be called. Written in JavaScript though but we can understand.

We will send in request the case Id and API will in response return the case status

You don't need to deploy webhook. You only need to make it run locally and test. And allow them to test, while keeping the ngrok server running on your machine. 
Once client is satisfied with production they will deploy it by own

The client background is, they are a data recovery company. If hard disk issues than they retrive data

I request that you don't take this Sunday off. We have a 2 days deadline. After the project, I will give you a day off in next week working days

It should have proper fallback intents, context based fallback intents

I know you will do great. Good luck!
